## Hi there 👋

I'm passionate about combining technology with amateur radio! Here’s what I’m currently working on:

- 🔭 **CalamariDash**: Integrating Affirmatech's HamDash and CQRLog to enable Linux contesters to display real-time scores on a shared leaderboard with other participants.
- 🌐 **Squid Spots**: A web-based POTA (Parks on the Air) logger that centralizes user activation logs in a single database.

### Collaboration
