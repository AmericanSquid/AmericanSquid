## Hi there 👋

I'm passionate about combining technology with amateur radio! Here’s what I’m currently working on:

- 🔭 **CalamariDash**: Integrating Affirmatech's HamDash and CQRLog to enable Linux contesters to display real-time scores on a shared leaderboard with other participants.
- 🌐 **Squid Spots**: A web-based POTA (Parks on the Air) logger that centralizes user activation logs in a single database.
- 🐳 **MeshSense**: A streamlined fork of the original project, removing Electron and deployed via Docker.

### What I'm Learning
- 🌱 Currently learning **JavaScript**! As a relatively new developer, I believe hands-on projects are the best way to learn, and I’m excited to continue improving my skills.

### Collaboration
- 👯 I’m always open to collaborating on **amateur radio applications**.

### Ask Me About
- 💬 **Ham radio**, **server building**, **creating music**, or **Baltimore history**—these are some of my many passions!
